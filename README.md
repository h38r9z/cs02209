Submission Requirements
To receive credit for the assignment, your submission must fulfill these   requirements:
•         It must include all the source code files necessary   for your   application.
•         Each   source   code   file   must   begin   with   a   box   comment   that   identifies   you,   the   course, the project,   and the due   date.
•         It   must   include   a   makefile   that   builds   your   application   on   the   SoC   server   when   I   enter the one-word command make on the Linux   command   line.   There must   be   no   build-time errors. Building must produce an executable application called   a.out.
•         The makefile must not auto-run the application after it finishes building.
